The responsible for the logistics of the space will be Mrs Goretti, she will be available for any information regarding the location of the washing room, gym or dressing room. 

## The practice

Besides comfortable clothes, since the gym can be colder in the morning, I recommend warmer clothes or to be dressed, in a way that you can easily adjust your body temperature according your needs. 

Thick socks or shoes with a thin sole, are advised for the practice. 

## Breakfast  

Although Chi Kung is not a strenuous exercise, it is advisable not to skip breakfast. 

If you are prone to low blood sugar, it's recommended that you bring along with you some light food. 

## Lunch

Besides the near restaurants, you can also bring your food and stay indoors or outdoors in the school during the lunch break. 

## Payments 

If there is some value remaining, the total payment should be done during the tea break.
